# salt states for sayz

I'll move all of my dot-files and installation habits to SaaltStack states.

## TODO
 - write states for OpenSUSE first of all.
 - add a state to install basic packages
 - add configuration files states like /etc/resolv.conf
 - add user management states
 - add support for debian os_family
 - customize the all states for desktop and server installation
 - convert fileserver-backend to git
